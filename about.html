       	My name is Carl Grech and I am currently a student at the University of Malta. I am studying for a Diploma in Design Foundation Studies, at the Faculty for the Built Environment.
        <br/><br/>
        Throughout this year I have acquired many skills that give me the means to create such a versatile portfolio. Throughout the first semester we were introduced to freehand drawing and mainly experimented with the stool, various forms of trees and the perspectives of the streets at our old beautiful city of Mdina. Through these medium, form was tackled as well.
         <br/><br/>Photography was also an aspect which was tackled in detail and form of 3D spaces was understood. I enjoyed experimenting with the camera and it was utterly satisfying to see my finished products.
